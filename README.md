# bandStand

This is a website for connecting customers looking for bands for an event and bands looking to be hired.  Costumers can create an 
account, search available artists by various criteria, leave reviews for a band, and give a band a rating.  In addition, users can
book bands right on the website.  Bands who use the site have a dedicated page on which to display photos, recordings, videos, and 
information. They can also manage incoming event requests.  In addition, there is another access level for an Admin to view all
users, artists, requests, etc.  Admin level access enables the deletion of events, users, artists, confirming/unconfirming of 
events, etc.

This website uses a MySql database created by the authors of the website, Java POJO Entities to map to the database via JPA/Hibernate
Spring MVC, and JSP/JSTL on the front-end along with Bootstrap and custom css for styling.
